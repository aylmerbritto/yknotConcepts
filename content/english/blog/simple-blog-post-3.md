If you are seeking an appointment. (The patient). 
    Say goodbye to the old-fashioned way of waiting in the patient halls of the clinic/ hospitals. Book instant appointments with the best doctors on field. Avail yourself the golden ticket of direct entry to the doctor’s room. 

    Ditch the long journey to the doctor’s place, the unending mystery of when will the doctor come? The long boring waits at the patient halls. 

    Use the ----- app, know your doctor before your visit, look for his credentials, read what people got to say about him through their reviews and book yourself an appointment with the nearest best doctor. 

    You can also check for the doctor’s availability before visiting them directly without an appointment. 

If you are giving an appointment. (The doctor)
    
    Spending too much time in the clinic waiting for patients? Well, not anymore. Register your clinic/ hospital in the app. Schedule appointments beforehand, pre-plan your entire day. 

    You can also track and get to know the busiest day, busiest time slots, highest foot falls and many more. 
 
    Thanks for always looking out for the needy but doctors too have a life. Sequence your own day and treat yourself with the break you deserve.  

    Let’s get started! Now, we’ll go save some lives, shall we? 

What makes the app stand alone? 
    
    1.	Have you seen the small clinic, the one at the end of the main road near your home? The not so famous for its brand but the doctor is indeed experienced kind of a clinic? 

    Yes, you can find him in the app too. Because we don’t believe in just the name of the brands, we do in good service too. 

    Not just the well-established hospitals, you can find the small clinics near and around your home too. Because a good service doesn’t always have to relate with high brand hospitals. 
    Sometimes all it takes is a small chit from the 70-year-old doctor who’s been in service forever at the end of the main road. 

    2.	 You can log in with the same ID irrespective of your name tag. If you are the dentist searching looking out for patients or you are a dentist searching for a paediatrician, orthopaedic surgeon for yourself or for kids, family members you still use the same ID. 

    Life is complicated, we get it. Let us not make it even more complicated with the fancy doctor-patient IDs. Can we once and for all make things simpler? 

Our mission. 
    
    our mission is to make you embrace your fear and make your doctors visit more fun and less complicated. Just kidding, we want to deliver our people, you, with the best health care. A good Health must neither be a luxury nor an option.

 
    We believe in a healthy- physically, emotionally and psychologically balanced society. And the first step towards such a big mission is the ---- app. Serving our people with the health care they deserve is our true and ultimate goal.
